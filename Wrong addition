/* From this solution we get to learn many things.
-> To solve the problem it is not complete that we define a proper approach but along with it we need to master the skill of representing that approach in the form of a flawless code.
-> We need to master the skill of logical,precise and an accurate programming,just defining an approach is incomplete it should must be represented in the form of an error less code.
