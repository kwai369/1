/* By comparing this two solutions we get to learn that we don't have to rely on inbuilt functions and directly implemet them in to the problem.
But we need to learn to built logic according to the problem.For instance sometimes the problem is really straightforward and asks to do a 
particular thing which can be done through the direct implementation of one/more inbuilt function/s,but that's not the problem really wants us
to do the problem wants us to think logically about problem and using that logic form an even more effecient and simpler method than the
inbuilt functions.Because just implementing the inbuilt functions may not be effecient enough according to the problem,the problem wants us to 
built our logical skills not our skill of understanding an inbuilt fuction from Geeksforgeeks copying it and pasting(or implementing) it in our program. */
