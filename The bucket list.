/* Solution 2:- 
 We are not be able to recall the second solution. 

 Testcases results. 
 -> The first solution satisfies all the testcases.
 -> Where as the second solution satisfies only one testcases and produces wrong answer on all the other testcases. 
 Mistake in second solution. 
 -> The second solution was not produced much wih the co-relation of logical connections present in the problem statement it was produced more based on the logical connections present in the testcases.
 -> The first solution was produced much with the interpretation of logical connections present in the problem statement. */
