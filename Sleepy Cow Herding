/* There are two mistakes that we have done in this problem they are as follows. 
-> Draw lots of small cases to gain a better understanding of the problem. If you're having trouble debugging, draw more cases. If you don't know how to start with a problem, draw more cases. Whenever you don't know how to further approach a problem, you're probably missing an important observation, so draw more cases and make observations about properties of the problem.
-> Don't get stuck on any specific idea, unless you see an entire solution. Trying to complete search an ad hoc problem could end up wasting a lot of your time in contest.
